# Cloudformation
CloudFormation is a service that allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file called a template. You can use .json, .yaml, .template, or .txt to describe what AWS resources(like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances) you want to create and configure. If you want to design visually, you can use AWS CloudFormation Designer.
